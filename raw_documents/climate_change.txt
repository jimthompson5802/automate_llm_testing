## **Climate Change and the Future of the Planet**  

### **Introduction**  
Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues, driven by human activity, fossil fuel consumption, and deforestation. The consequences of rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss threaten ecosystems and human societies.  

### **Scientific Consensus and Causes**  
Over 97% of climate scientists agree that human activities are the primary cause of climate change. The greenhouse effect, where gases like COâ‚‚ trap heat in the atmosphere, has intensified due to industrialization.  

### **Effects of Climate Change**  
- Rising sea levels threaten coastal cities.  
- More frequent wildfires, hurricanes, and droughts.  
- Disruption of agriculture and food supplies.  
- Loss of biodiversity and habitat destruction.  

### **Mitigation and Solutions**  
Governments and organizations advocate for renewable energy, carbon capture, and reforestation. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to curb global warming, but stronger action is needed to achieve sustainability.
